# Building-Networks
Tracking progress across building network teams

#Overview

All the Building Network heartbeats and weekly updates are in the "Issues" section of this Github repository. This is a brief tutorial to help you get started with Github Issues.

#Why we're using Github Issues for BN

This tool allows us to better collaborate and coordinate across Hives and Hubs, as well as provide a record for how the heartbeat process is going.

We are here to help in case you get stuck or need help at anytime. Don't worry -- you can't break anything!


#Getting started with Github Issues

Github Issues is a powerful way to collaborate on Github. It was originally designed as an "issue tracker" or project management tool for editing code. However, its simple interface allows us to adapt it for Building Network demands.

To get started, you'll first have to create a Github account.

Once you've created your account, send your Github user name to annmarie@mozillafoundation.org. You will then be notified that you have access to the Building Networks repository.

#Github Etiquette

Please be advised that your comments will be recorded and may be viewed publicly at any time. We will not publish anyone's personal information, and we ask you to respect this in your comments. People who are submitting a session are putting themselves out there and we are invested in ensuring they have a good experience with us, regardless whether their session is accepted or not.

Please be aware that many people are using Github for the first time, so be patient and offer to help if you see someone in need.

#Improving this process
